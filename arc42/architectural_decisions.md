# Architectural Decisions

In the development of the University Management Application, several key architectural decisions have been made to ensure the project's success, scalability, and sustainability. These decisions are critical in shaping the overall architecture of the system and its ability to meet both current and future needs.

## Technology Stack Selection
- **Front-End Development**: React has been chosen for its component-based architecture, enhancing the responsiveness and scalability of the user interface.
- **Back-End Development**: Node.js is selected for its non-blocking I/O model, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent user requests.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is chosen for its flexibility in handling diverse data types and scalability.

## Cloud-Based Infrastructure
- The application will be deployed on AWS, supporting scalability, high availability, and robust security features essential for protecting sensitive educational data.

## Microservices Architecture
- Adopting a microservices architecture enhances scalability and maintainability. It allows individual modules like Student Management and Course Management to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## API-First Approach
- An API-first design facilitates integration with existing systems like the Student Information System and Financial Management System, ensuring seamless data exchange and integration with third-party services.

## Responsive Web Design
- To accommodate the diverse range of devices used by students and faculty, the application is designed to be responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Scalable Reporting and Analytics Module
- The architecture includes a scalable solution for reporting and analytics, capable of handling large volumes of data and providing real-time insights.

## Automated Testing and CI/CD
- The project incorporates automated testing and CI/CD pipelines to maintain high code quality, streamline the development process, and reduce the risk of bugs or downtime.
