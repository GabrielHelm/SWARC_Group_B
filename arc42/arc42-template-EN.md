<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 8. Cross-cutting Concepts

The following section describes aspects of the application that affect multiple components and can, therefore, not be associated with individual modules.

**Concept 1: Logging**  
All components of the application must log events using the same pattern. The production environment is required to log at the level "INFO". These logs must be managed by a monitoring system and events with serious consequences must notify relevant staff members. 


**Concept 2: Synchronization**  
The application mediates between users (students and staff) and an external information source (the student information system).  
The database is required to be consistent with the information received by the student information system and changes to relevant information received from users (e.g.: personal information change by student) must be relayed to the external system.  


**Concept 3: Privacy and Compliance**  
The application must be compliant with relevant legal obligations, especially concerning privacy. This includes the General Data Protection Regulation as well as University bylaws.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 9. Architecture Decisions

In the development of the University Management Application, several key architectural decisions have been made to ensure the project's success, scalability, and sustainability. These decisions are critical in shaping the overall architecture of the system and its ability to meet both current and future needs.

## Technology Stack Selection
- **Front-End Development**: React has been chosen for its component-based architecture, enhancing the responsiveness and scalability of the user interface.
- **Back-End Development**: Node.js is selected for its non-blocking I/O model, ensuring efficient handling of concurrent user requests.
- **Data Storage**: MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is chosen for its flexibility in handling diverse data types and scalability.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: LDAP is selected for its hierarchical structure, lightweight footprint and scalability.

## Cloud-Based Infrastructure
The application will be deployed on AWS, supporting scalability, high availability, and robust security features essential for protecting sensitive educational data.

## Microservices Architecture
Adopting a microservices architecture enhances scalability and maintainability. It allows individual modules like Student Management and Course Management to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## API-First Approach
An API-first design facilitates integration with existing systems like the Student Information System and Financial Management System, ensuring seamless data exchange and integration with third-party services.

## Responsive Web Design
To accommodate the diverse range of devices used by students and faculty, the application is designed to be responsive across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Scalable Reporting and Analytics Module
The architecture includes a scalable solution for reporting and analytics, capable of handling large volumes of data and providing real-time insights.

## Automated Testing and CI CD
The project incorporates automated testing and CI/CD pipelines to maintain high code quality, streamline the development process, and reduce the risk of bugs or downtime.

| Back-End Technology         | Node.js Runtime Environment            | Node.js is used for the backend services.                                                | Node.js, being single-threaded, might struggle under heavy computational tasks, leading to potential performance issues. Additionally, the asynchronous nature of Node.js can lead to callback hell if not handled with modern practices like async/await. |
| Database System             | MongoDB NoSQL Database                 | MongoDB is used as the primary database.                                                 | The NoSQL nature of MongoDB may lead to challenges in data consistency and integrity, especially in complex transaction scenarios. There might be a need for additional handling to ensure ACID properties.                                                |
| Microservices Architecture  | Microservices-based Architecture       | The application uses a microservices architecture for modular development.               | Microservices introduce complexity in terms of deployment, monitoring, and inter-service communication. This could lead to technical debt in managing a larger number of services and ensuring their seamless interaction.                                 |
| API Integration             | Third-party APIs                       | The application integrates with various third-party APIs for additional functionalities. | Third-party API changes or deprecations can lead to unexpected failures or the need for frequent updates, creating technical debt.                                                                                                                         |
| Responsive Design           | Responsive Web Design Technologies     | The application is designed to be responsive across various devices.                     | Continuous updates and testing across multiple devices and screen sizes can lead to technical debt, especially if new devices with different resolutions and aspect ratios are released.                                                                   |
| Scalability Concerns        | Scalable Cloud Infrastructure          | The application is expected to scale based on user demand.                               | Improper handling of scalability can lead to performance bottlenecks. Over-reliance on auto-scaling features can increase operational costs unexpectedly.                                                                                                  |
| Student Information System  | Existing University Information System | Our application will integrate with the existing information system.                     | The information system has security vulnerabilities and is not yet compliant with current privacy regulations.                                                                                                                                             |
| Financial Management System | Financial Management System API        | Our application will integrate with the existing financial management system.            | The financial management system offers an API, however, there is no current documentation available.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Cloud Deployment            | Amazon Web Services (AWS)              | Our application will be deployed on AWS.                                                 | This introduces vendor buy-in which could cause technical debt in the future.                                                                                                                                                                              |
