| Front-End Framework           | React Library                         | The application's front end is developed using React.                                                 | React's frequent updates may require regular refactoring of the codebase to stay up-to-date. This can lead to technical debt if not managed properly.                                           |
| Back-End Technology           | Node.js Runtime Environment           | Node.js is used for the backend services.                                                             | Node.js, being single-threaded, might struggle under heavy computational tasks, leading to potential performance issues. Additionally, the asynchronous nature of Node.js can lead to callback hell if not handled with modern practices like async/await. |
| Database System               | MongoDB NoSQL Database                | MongoDB is used as the primary database.                                                              | The NoSQL nature of MongoDB may lead to challenges in data consistency and integrity, especially in complex transaction scenarios. There might be a need for additional handling to ensure ACID properties.                                           |
| Microservices Architecture    | Microservices-based Architecture     | The application uses a microservices architecture for modular development.                           | Microservices introduce complexity in terms of deployment, monitoring, and inter-service communication. This could lead to technical debt in managing a larger number of services and ensuring their seamless interaction.                           |
| API Integration               | Third-party APIs                      | The application integrates with various third-party APIs for additional functionalities.             | Third-party API changes or deprecations can lead to unexpected failures or the need for frequent updates, creating technical debt.                                                               |
| Responsive Design             | Responsive Web Design Technologies   | The application is designed to be responsive across various devices.                                  | Continuous updates and testing across multiple devices and screen sizes can lead to technical debt, especially if new devices with different resolutions and aspect ratios are released.                                  |
| Scalability Concerns          | Scalable Cloud Infrastructure         | The application is expected to scale based on user demand.                                            | Improper handling of scalability can lead to performance bottlenecks. Over-reliance on auto-scaling features can increase operational costs unexpectedly.                                        |
| Student Information System    | Existing University Information System| Our application will integrate with the existing information system.                                  | The information system has security vulnerabilities and is not yet compliant with current privacy regulations.                                                                                 |
| Financial Management System   | Financial Management System API       | Our application will integrate with the existing financial management system.                         | The financial management system offers an API, however, there is no current documentation available.                                                                                           |
| Cloud Deployment              | Amazon Web Services (AWS)             | Our application will be deployed on AWS.                                                              | This introduces vendor buy-in which could cause technical debt in the future.                                                                                                                   |
